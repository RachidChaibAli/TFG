Generate a JSON object for a Unity 2D scene with the following structure:

The field "sceneSize" must be an object with "width" and "height" in units.

Infer an appropriate scene size based on the scene description and the number and type of NPCs and interactive objects present. For example, a scene described as "a vast open field" should be larger than "a small room."

The field "positions" must be an array of objects, each with:

"id": the unique id of the NPC or interactive object (including "player" for the player character)

"position": an object with "x" and "y" coordinates

Assign logical positions for all NPCs and objects, ensuring they fit within the inferred scene size and are spaced appropriately.

Always include the position for the player (id: "player").

Use only the ids present in the scene (NPCs and interactive objects), plus "player".
Return only the JSON as output.

Example structure:

json
{
  "sceneSize": { "width": 20, "height": 15 },
  "positions": [
    { "id": "player", "position": { "x": 2, "y": 3 } },
    { "id": "scene_2_npc_1", "position": { "x": 5, "y": 7 } },
    { "id": "scene_2_object_1", "position": { "x": 10, "y": 4 } }
  ]
}
Base the scene size and all positions on the description and the elements present in the scene.

IMPORTANT return only a json without any aditional text.

The json containing the info of the scene and its components:
