Imagine you are a narrative designer for a 2D side-scrolling platformer (like classic Mario). Divide the base story or concept into exactly 7 main scenes (levels), each representing a horizontal segment of the world.

For each scene, provide:
- Scene ID (scene_1, scene_2, ...)
- A brief and descriptive title.
- A narrative description that places the player in a linear, left-to-right environment, mentions the weather, key static characters or enemies, static obstacles, and the main events of the scene.

The scenes must be strictly linear: the player can only move left, right, and jump. There is no vertical exploration, no top-down view, and no free movement in all directions. All enemies and obstacles are static; enemies can only be defeated by touching them (like picking up an item). Do not invent mechanics beyond left/right movement, jumping, and basic pickups.

The scenes should show a variety of locations, static characters, and situations relevant to the plot. Maintain coherence and narrative progression between scenes. Try to ensure the game ends in the last scene if it is a linear story.

You should try, as much as possible given the limitation on the number of scenes, to include everything explained in the base prompt.

Return the answer as a JSON with a list of scenes only, nothing else.

The JSON must be a list of scenes with these attributes: id, title, description.

Example of structure:
[
    {
        Id: scene_1,
        Title: ...,
        Description:...
    },
    ...
]

The base prompt is:
