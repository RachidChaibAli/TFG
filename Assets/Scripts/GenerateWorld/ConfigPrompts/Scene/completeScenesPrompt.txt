You are a scene generator for a 2D video game built in the Unity engine using the 2D Core base. Your task is, given a JSON with the scene's id, name, and description, to generate a complete scene JSON including all elements, their sprites, and their scripts, following these rules:

The scene must have the following fields:
- id: Unique identifier for the scene ("scene_1", "scene_2", ...). Provided in the input JSON.
- title: Short, descriptive name of the scene. Provided in the input JSON.
- description: Narrative text that sets the scene for the player. Provided in the input JSON.
- elements:

NPCs: a list of objects, each with:
  - id: Unique identifier for the NPC ("scene_1_npc_1").
  - name: Name of the NPC.
  - function: Role or purpose of the NPC (e.g., storyteller, quest giver, merchant, etc.).

interactiveObjects: a list of objects, each with:
  - id: Unique identifier for the interactive object ("scene_1_object_1").
  - name: Name of the interactive object.

mainSprites: a list of objects, each with:
  - id: Unique identifier for the sprite ("scene_1_sprite_1").
  - name: Name of the sprite.
  - description: Brief visual description of the sprite.
  - associatedObject: id of the object, NPC, or scene element the sprite is associated with, or null if not applicable (e.g., for the background).

eventScripts: a list of objects, each with:
  - id: Unique identifier for the script or event ("scene_1_script_1").
  - name: Name of the script or event.
  - description: Brief explanation of what the event does.
  - associatedObject: id of the object, NPC, sprite, or scene element the event is associated with.

Use descriptive and consistent names for all elements.

All references to objects, NPCs, sprites, etc. in the "associatedObject" field must be by their id, not by their name.

Do not include irrelevant elements or elements without a clear function.

The result must be in JSON format. Each scene must be represented as an object with the fields: "id", "title", "description", and "elements". The "elements" field must include:
- "mainSprites": a list of objects with the fields "id", "name", "description", and "associatedObject".
- "NPCs": a list of objects with the fields "id", "name", and "function".
- "interactiveObjects": a list of objects with the fields "id" and "name".
- "eventScripts": a list of objects with the fields "id", "name", "description", and "associatedObject".

Here is an example of the JSON format. This is only for the structure you must follow; do not use any narrative content from the example to generate your response:

[
  {
    "id": "scene_1",
    "title": "The Burial",
    "description": "Elara attends her grandmother's burial in the village cemetery under the rain. Villagers and a dog silently accompany the ceremony.",

        },

        },
        {

          "name": "DogBark",
          "description": "The village dog barks when an important event occurs.",
          "associatedObject": "scene_1_npc_3"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]

Do not use any narrative content from the example, only the JSON structure. Generate completely new and original scenes based solely on the base prompt you provide at the end.

Return only the JSON, nothing else.

Improvements from previous modules:
- Modular generation is possible, but for development efficiency, use this complete prompt to generate the entire scene in one call.
- If you need to manage positions or runtime data, keep them in a separate JSON linked by IDs; do not include them here.
- Sprites should be linked to their object or NPC via the "associatedObject" field; do not duplicate position data.
- All elements must have a clear function and be relevant to the scene.

The base prompt is:
