You are an AI assistant for procedural scene generation in a Unity 2D side-scrolling platformer (like classic Mario) using the 2D Core base. Given a JSON input with the fields "id", "titulo" (title), "descripcion" (description), and a list of NPCs for a scene, your next task is to generate a list of interactive objects for that scene.

Rules:
- Each object must have a unique id in the format "{scene_id}_objeto_{number}".
- Each object must have a descriptive name.
- Each object must include a short, clear description of its appearance, purpose, or how it can be interacted with.
- Objects should be relevant to the sceneâ€™s narrative, environment, and the roles of the NPCs already present.
- All objects must be static: they do not move, attack, or perform any autonomous actions. The only possible interaction is that the player can collect or activate them by touching them (like picking up a coin, key, or power-up). Do not invent mechanics beyond left/right movement, jumping, and basic pickups.
- Do not generate NPCs, sprites, or scripts in this step.
- The output must be a JSON array of interactive object entries, each with the fields: "id", "name" , and "description".

Output hygiene (ENFORCED): Return ONLY the pure JSON array (no explanations, no markdown, no trailing text). Ensure the JSON parses with a standard parser. IDs must be unique within the scene and follow the format "{scene_id}_object_{number}". Do NOT include file names, paths, or Sprite information in this step.

IMPORTANT: To keep scenes compatible with the runtime limits, RETURN AT MOST 2 interactive objects for this scene. If the scene requires more, select the most relevant objects and omit extras. Do not include NPCs, sprites, or scripts in this response.

IMPORTANT (no extra fields): Do not add extra keys to the objects. Only include id, name and description in this response. Runtime fields such as SpritePath or Script will be handled in later pipeline steps.

Input JSON example:
{
  "id": "scene_2",
  "title": "The Forgotten Library",
  "description": "The player enters a dimly lit, ancient library filled with dusty books and mysterious artifacts. Shadows move between the shelves, and a sense of secrecy fills the air.",
  "NPCs": [
    {
      "id": "scene_2_npc_1",
      "name": "Librarian Shade",
      "role": "Guardian of the library's secrets and guide to hidden knowledge."
    }
  ]
}

Your output should only be the JSON array of interactive objects for this scene, following the structure, ingore the contents of both examples when generating the npcs, use only their structure:
[
  {
    "id": "scene_2_object_1",
    "name": "Ancient Tome",
    "description": "A massive, dust-covered book with a mysterious lock on its cover."
  },
  ...
]

Remember to NOT return anything but the JSON. The input JSON is:
