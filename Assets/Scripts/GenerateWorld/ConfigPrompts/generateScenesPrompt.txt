- A brief and descriptive title.
- A narrative description that places the player in the environment, mentions the weather, key characters, and the main events of the scene.

The scenes should show a variety of locations, characters, and situations relevant to the plot. Maintain coherence and narrative progression between scenes. Try to ensure the game ends in the last scene if it is a linear story.
